preprocessing.py
----------------
Shared text-cleaning pipeline used by ALL three models so the comparison is fair.

Pipeline steps:
    1. lowercase
    2. strip URLs, HTML
    3. normalize evasion patterns (leetspeak, spaced-out letters, repeated chars)
    4. strip hashtag symbol, remaining digits/punctuation/special characters
    5. tokenize
    6. remove stopwords
    7. lemmatize (reduce words to their base form)

It uses NLTK when available. If NLTK data can't be downloaded (common on locked-down
machines), it falls back to a built-in stopword list and skips lemmatization, so the
code still runs end-to-end.

# Evasion-pattern normalization
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# People trying to slip an offensive word past a filter commonly do one of
# three things - all handled BEFORE the "strip everything but letters" step,
# so the underlying word survives instead of being destroyed:
#   1. Leetspeak substitution:  n1gg4, @sshole, sh1t   -> letter equivalents
#   2. Spaced-out letters:      n.i.g.g.a, s h i t      -> collapsed together
#   3. Repeated-character spam: nigggggga, stuuupid     -> collapsed down
#
# A DELIBERATE TRADE-OFF, worth noting in your report: leading '@' characters
# (e.g. "@johndoe") are stripped as mention markers, same as before evasion
# normalization was added - real-world testing showed substituting a leading
# '@' to 'a' (e.g. "@something" -> "asomething") produced garbled,
# out-of-vocabulary tokens that triggered false positives via the character
# n-gram features far more often than it caught genuine evasion. '@'
# occurring mid-word (e.g. "a@@hole") is still substituted to 'a', since
# that pattern is unambiguously a deliberate evasion attempt, not a mention.
#
# IMPORTANT (also worth a line in your report): this catches the common,
# well-known evasion patterns, but it is not a complete solution - evasion is
# an arms race, and new obfuscation tricks will always exist. The character
# n-gram features used in the models (see models/*.py) provide a second,
# complementary layer of robustness: they can catch NEW obfuscation patterns
# this normalization doesn't explicitly know about, because "n1gg4" and
# "nigga" still share overlapping 3-5 character substrings even before any
# substitution is applied.
