predictor.py
------------
The prediction engine used by the Streamlit app. It loads a saved model bundle
and, for a given comment, returns:
    - per-label probability / confidence
    - the binary prediction (threshold 0.5)
    - the words that most influenced the decision (for highlighting)
    - a short plain-English explanation

Works for all three models:
    Logistic Regression / Random Forest -> predict_proba
    Linear SVM (no predict_proba)        -> decision_function squashed to 0..1
Word influence:
    linear models -> signed coefficients (coef_)
    random forest -> feature importances
