"""
annotate_data.py
=================
A lightweight labeling tool for the group to manually tag the comments you
crawled. Crawled data has no labels - a human has to decide, for each
comment: is it abusive, and if so, which group does it target?

Run from the project root (a separate app from the main one):
    streamlit run crawler/annotate_data.py

Output: data/crawled/<source>_labeled.csv, already in the final binary schema
(comment, abusive, Race, Religion, Gender, Sexual_Orientation, Miscellaneous)
so it plugs straight into crawler/merge_datasets.py afterwards.

Tip: you do NOT need to label every comment you crawled. Even 50-100 labeled
comments is a legitimate, honest extension to your dataset - label a
realistic amount for your timeline rather than feeling obligated to do all of
them.

Working as a group: progress saves after every single comment to the same
output file, and the tool automatically skips anything already labeled when
reopened. So one member can label 50, close it, and a teammate can open the
same file afterwards and pick up exactly where it was left off - just make
sure everyone is working from the same copy of the file (e.g. push/pull via
GitHub between sessions, or share one machine/drive).
