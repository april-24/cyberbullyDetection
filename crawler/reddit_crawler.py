reddit_crawler.py
==================
Collects comments from ENGLISH-language subreddits using Reddit's OFFICIAL
API (via the PRAW library) - not scraping, a proper authenticated API call.

Focused on topics likely to surface comments relevant to the two
weakest-performing categories in this project's evaluation (Gender and
Miscellaneous) - see SUBREDDITS below. (An earlier version of this project
targeted Malay-language subreddits; that was dropped as impractical for a
small group to reliably label, and English-only data collection was judged
more effective for directly improving the weak categories.)

** IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE USING **
As of November 2025, Reddit requires manual pre-approval for ALL API access,
including the free tier (their "Responsible Builder Policy"). Approval can
take 2-4 WEEKS. If your deadline is close, apply immediately, or use the
YouTube crawler instead (crawler/youtube_batch_crawler.py) which needs no
approval wait.

Setup (after approval):
    pip install praw
    1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps -> "create another app..."
    2. Choose type "script", fill in any name/description/redirect URI
       (redirect URI can be http://localhost:8080)
    3. Copy the client ID (under the app name) and client secret
    4. Fill in REDDIT_CLIENT_ID / REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET below, or set them as
       environment variables (REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET)

Output: data/crawled/reddit_english_raw.csv (UNLABELED)

Run:
